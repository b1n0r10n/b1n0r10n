## 🧠 About Me

I'm a web developer and scientific programmer passionate about merging clean code with scientific clarity. With a unique background at the intersection of astronomy, and data science, I enjoy building things that serve both curiosity and utility.

Currently, I work at **CELLS UPI (Center for Excellence of Lesson and Learning Studies)**, where I designed and developed the official institutional website to enhance its public profile and digital accessibility. Previously, I’ve collaborated on data-driven and ML-based projects ranging from astronomical star cluster simulations to cancer classification and crypto forecasting models.

My early journey in science began with astronomy olympiads and student mentoring—eventually expanding into software engineering and machine learning. I regularly explore open datasets like Gaia DR3 or VizieR and combine them with Python tools to generate new insights.

Whether it’s deploying educational portals, parsing star catalogs, or training ML models on biomedical data, my goal remains the same: make knowledge more usable, scalable, and inspiring.

> I build things with science in mind and purpose in every function.
